/// Creates constraints that increments a 32-bits pointer by `amount` bytes.
///
/// Preconditions:
/// - `amount` must be a power of two,
/// - `amount` must be in range [1, 0x10000],
/// - `pre_low` must be a multiple of amount,
/// - `pre_low` must be in range [0, 0xffff].
/// - `int(pre_high) * 0x10000 + int(pre_low) + amount` must be in range [0, 0xffffffff].
///
/// The pointers are given in 2 16-bit limbs. This function returns a set of constraints
/// ensuring that the following are equal:
/// - (int(post_high) * 0x10000 + int(post_low))
/// - (int(pre_high) * 0x10000 + int(pre_low) + amount)
///
/// The returned constraints are not automatically added to the constraints set. This is so the
/// caller will be able to latch-disable them in rows they aren't needed.
///
/// This constr function introduces 2 new witness column and some helper constraints.
