# Degree range

Machines can specify the number of steps they run for. Three parameters come into play:
- `min_degree` expresses that the machine will run for a minimum of `min_degree` steps, included
- `max_degree` expresses that the machine will run for a maximum of `max_degree` steps, included
- `degree` is a shortcut to set `min_degree` and `max_degree` to the same value
