# PIL

powdr PIL is the lower level of abstraction in powdr. It is strongly inspired by and compatible with [Polygon zkEVM PIL](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pilcom/). We refer to the [Polygon zkEVM PIL documentation](https://zkevm.polygon.technology/PIL/introduction) and document deviations from the original design here.
