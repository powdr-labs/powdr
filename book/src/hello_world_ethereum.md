# Hello World on Ethereum

This example is a variation of the previous [Hello World](./hello_world.md),
targeting verification on Ethereum. In this example we will cover how to
generate proofs directly using a Keccak transcript instead of the Poseidon
transcript of the previous example, which will enable us to verify proofs
onchain. There are almost no differences from the CLI perspective.

```
{{#include ../../test_data/asm/book/hello_world.asm}}
```

Since the following command creates a proof, a Solidity verifier, and verifies
the proof on the EVM, we need to have `solc` available in the system. One easy
way to install it is by using [svm](https://github.com/alloy-rs/svm-rs).

```console
powdr pil test_data/asm/book/hello_world.asm --field bn254 --inputs 0 --prove-with halo2 --backend-options "snark_single" -f --params params.bin
```

The extra parameter `--backend-options snark_single` tells powdr to produce a single
SNARK that uses Keccak. The option `-f` forces overwriting the compiled files
that have been generated before, which is useful if you are running the examples
on the same directory as the previous example.

When the a proof is generated, it is verified on a simulated EVM transaction as well!

```console
Verifying SNARK in the EVM...
```

We can observe again that a proof was created at `hello_world_proof.bin`.

Now we can generate a Solidity verifier, using the same setup (`params`) as the
previous example:

```console
powdr export-verifier test_data/asm/book/hello_world.asm --field bn254 --backend halo2 --backend-options "snark_single" --params params.bin
```

A Solidity file `verifier.sol` is generated. You can verify the same proof that
we just generated by passing it to the contract together with the public inputs
(which we have not used so far).

> Note that the more complex your VM is, the larger the verifier contract will be. In some cases, it might exceed Ethereum's contract size limit. You can mitigate that by using proof recursion on proofs that use Poseidon transcripts. See the [next section for details](./hello_world_ethereum_aggregation.md).
