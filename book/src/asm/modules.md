# Modules

powdr exposes a module system to help organise and reuse code.

```
{{#include ../../../test_data/asm/book/modules.asm}}
```

Note that a module can't be called `std`, as this name is reserved for the powdr standard library.

Similar to Rust, any reference that cannot be resolved is lookup up once more in ``std::prelude``.
This module exposes basic types like ``Option``. This means that you can use `Option` anywhere
and do not have to use `std::utils::Option`.
