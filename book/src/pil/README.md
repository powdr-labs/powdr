# PIL

powdr-pil is the lower level of abstraction in powdr. It is strongly inspired by [Polygon zkEVM PIL](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pilcom/). We refer to the [Polygon zkEVM PIL documentation](https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/spec/pil) and document deviations from the original design here.
