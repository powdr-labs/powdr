# Instructions

Instructions are declared as part of a powdr virtual machine. Their inputs and outputs are [assignment registers](./registers.md) as well as labels. Once defined, they can be called by any function in this machine.

# Local instructions

A local instruction is the simplest type of instruction. It is called local because its behavior is defined using constraints over registers and columns of the machine it is defined in.

```
{{#include ../../../test_data/asm/book/instructions.asm:local}}
```

Instructions feature:
- a name
- some inputs
- some outputs
- a set of [powdr-pil](../pil/) constraints to activate when the instruction is called

# External instructions

An external instruction delegates its implementation to a function/operation from a submachine.
When called, the inputs and outputs of the declared instruction are mapped into a call to the submachine function.

Assume we have a submachine with a single operation `add`:
```
{{#include ../../../test_data/asm/book/instructions.asm:submachine}}
```

An external instruction calling into this operation can be declared as follows:
```
{{#include ../../../test_data/asm/book/instructions.asm:trivial}}
```
The left-hand side of the definition declares the local instruction and which assignment registers are used in its inputs and outputs.
It describes how the instruction is used.
The right-hand side of the definition specifies the call to the external operation, with its inputs and outputs.
All assignment registers on the left-hand side must be used in the call to the external operation.

In the previous example, parameters of the instruction match exactly with how the target operation should be called, and the right-hand parameters can thus be omitted.
The following example shows more complex usages of external instructions:
```
{{#include ../../../test_data/asm/book/instructions.asm:main}}
```

> Note that external instructions cannot currently link to functions of the same machine: they delegate computation to a submachine.
