*powdr* provides state-of-the-art performance and security to zkVMs, enhancing them with compiler-based techniques including static analysis and formal verification.

The main components are:

- [Autoprecompiles](https://www.powdr.org/blog/auto-acc-circuits): automated synthesis of guest-specific precompiles.
- Constraint Solver: compile-time solver used to detect potential optimizations and security issues.
- powdr-OpenVM: powdr extensions for [OpenVM](https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/).

For detailed documentation on powdr-asm, powdr-pil and podwrVM please visit [the powdr book](https://docs.powdr.org/).
