// Very simple write-once memory that let's you store any field element at
// an address from 0 to N-1. Any value can be written only once, writing two
// different values to the same address fails. If an uninitialized cell is
// read, the returned values is unconstrained.
// A typical use-case would be to pass the `value` column as an "external"
// witness. This way the prover can provide some input vector and the program
// can read the same input multiple times.

    //   instr mstore X, Y -> = memory.access X, Y ->;
