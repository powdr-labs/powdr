# Installation

The easiest way to start making ZK proofs with powdrVM is to install `cargo-powdr`:

```console
cargo install cargo-powdr
```

`cargo-powdr` is used to create and manage powdrVM projects, similar to `cargo` itself.

## Prerequisites

You will need the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) compiler and Cargo, the Rust package manager.
The easiest way to install both is with [`rustup.rs`](https://rustup.rs/).
