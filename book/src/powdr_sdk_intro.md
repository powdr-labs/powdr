# Introduction

**powdr** is a modular compiler stack to build zkVMs.
It is ideal for implementing existing VMs and experimenting with new designs with minimal boilerplate.

* Domain specific languages are used to specify the VM and its underlying constraints, not low level Rust code
* Automated witness generation
* Support for multiple provers as well as aggregation schemes
* Support for hand-optimized co-processors when performance is critical
* Built in Rust ðŸ¦€
