# It is hard to even make sense of what a random number means in the context of
# a ZK program. So, by default, any attempt of using the entropy source will
# panic at runtime. This includes the usage through `getrandom` or `std`
# features (e.g. HashMap).
#
# If you want the runtime to not panic, you must explicitly enable the
# `allow_fake_rand` feature to get a deterministic value instead.
